# Encryption As A Service Example

This repo seeks to provide an example that demonstrates how to protect sensitive data using Hashicorp Vault.  Encryption as a service, or the transit secret engine, provides an API that can be used to perform a variety of cryptographic operations such as encryption and decryption, signing, hashing, HMAC, etc.  It has other uses as well including secure key generation, providing a unified method for random number generation, and other things.

This repo contains a simple CRUD app that can integrate with Vault to protect customer records.

To be continued...  For now look in the setup directory.
